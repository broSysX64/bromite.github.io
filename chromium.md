# Chromium releases

Bromite provides vanilla Chromium releases built with same settings and optimizations of Bromite but without any patch.
This is mostly useful to detect new features/bugs in Chromium and compare functionality with Bromite, but it is as well a 100% vanilla working Chromium browser (with all the pros/cons).
