# Take back your browser

Bromite is Chromium plus ad blocking and privacy enhancements; take back your browser!

## Goals
Bromite aims at providing a no-clutter browsing experience without privacy-invasive features and with the addition of a fast ad-blocking engine.

Minimal UI changes are applied to help curbing the idea of "browser as an advertisement platform".

## Main features
* baked-in adblock engine with filters from EasyList, EasyPrivacy and others
* remove click-tracking and AMP from Google search results
* allow youtube/vimeo videos to play in background
* StartPage, DuckDuckGo and Qwant search engines
* Google search engine English-only with reduced tracking
* privacy enhancement patches from Inox patchset, ungoogled-chromium and Iridium projects
* webRTC, canvas, audio and other anti-fingerprinting mitigations
* all codecs included (proprietary, open H.264 etc.)
* built with official optimizations
