# Bromite v69 released

Notable in this version:
* added back support of WebRTC, mostly because upstream Chromium does not support building without it; although the feature has sane defaults in Bromite, it constitutes a security/privacy concern

Please report any bugs via the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues).
