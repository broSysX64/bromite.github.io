# Submissions for new logo

Bromite needs a new logo. The current logo is a derivation of [Chromium logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_11_Logo.svg) and it makes sense since Bromite is 99% Chromium, but for the sake of the project it is better to have an original one.

This post will be updated with further information and precisations.

**Update 28 September 22:30:** submission window is now closed

## How to submit your logo design

You can prepare a low resolution PNG (even watermarked) and submit it second these venues:
* by posting on the [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues/120), so that you can gather other users' feedback
* by sending it to [csagan5 via reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/csagan5)

Submissions will not be shared nor posted anywhere before or after the submission window ends, except obviously if it is picked as the official logo of Bromite.

## Inspiration material for this logo

Logo should obviously not look like Chromium logo, nor some other browser logo. A minimal design and the current color would be great to have, but are not mandatory inclusion/exclusion factors for your submission.

For example the logo - in its most basic design - could be a greenish world with a test tube overlayed.

You can probably also play with the idea of chemicals, since [real-world bromite is the salt of an acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromous_acid). You can find more [information about these salts here](https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&lpg=PA91&dq=bromite&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q=bromite&f=false).

This information is mentioned mostly as a curiosity, since it is the most directly related to the name, but the design can completely ignore it; it is not considered an advantage in any way for the logo design (and it would be quite difficult to use regardless).

Android icons should be adaptive: https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive

And - as a bonus - you could consider Material Design guidelines since it is the suggested style for Android anways: https://material.io/design/iconography/

## Is there a monetary compensation for this work?

Yes, a donation of 100$ which can be transferred via PayPal.

This open source project has little budget (made up of donations) and there is an allocated donation of 100$ for the creator of the picked logo.
The logo author and referral link will also be mentioned on the [project README on GitHub](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/blob/master/README.md).

The competition nature and the small amount of the donation are not intended to be offensive for the work of designers, but just as a symbolic incentive; the work that goes into designing a logo should be compensated much better and thus submissions for Bromite new logo are a donation themselves.

## How will the final deliverable look like?

The final deliverable should be in a vectorial editable file format, since it needs to be converted to SVG format, and it should be of good quality. The [Chromium logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_11_Logo.svg) is an example of a good SVG.

The license of the submitted work should be [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

## Is there a deadline for submissions?

No more submissions will be accepted after ~~5 October 23:59 UTC~~ 28 September 23:59 UTC. If no logo has been picked yet, this might be extended, but it is unlikely.
